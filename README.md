Application of Assertive Community Support and Inclusive Economy to Maternal Perinatal Mental Health

## Background
<p>
Perinatal is the period from conception (antenatal) to one year postpartum. This period is crucial for the health of both the mother and child due to the high risk of complications. Women often face psychological, physiological, and social challenges during this time, increasing their vulnerability to mental health issues, particularly depression and anxiety.
</p>
<p>
Perinatal depression, a serious yet treatable medical condition, affects 1 in 5 women globally (WHO, 2022). Its impact extends beyond mothers to children, increasing risks such as malnutrition, stunting, and developmental delays. Alarmingly, societal stigma often dismisses maternal mental health concerns, amplifying the issue.

## Limitation
<p>
This project is a <b>code-based front-end prototype</b>, showcasing a well-structured Flutter application designed as part of the System Interaction course in my university. It emphasizes my ability to build complex and interactive UI entirely from scratch, without relying on additional packages. By focusing solely on the core capabilities of Flutter, this project demonstrates my proficiency in implementing intricate designs and my commitment to mastering fundamental development skillsâ€”making it a standout piece in my portfolio.
</p>
<p> * This Project holds potential for future development. Plans may include integrating backend functionality, enhancing interactivity, and refining features to transform it into a fully functional application.</p>
